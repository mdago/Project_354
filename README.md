# Project_354

Here are the files required for the project. Iteration 2 under "src" is where the work needs to be done. The file "COMP 354.zip" is
a zip folder that can be directly imported to eclipse for easy editing.

The 'external' folder contains the Yahoo API jars that need to added to the project's build path so that the 'Display.java' file
can connect to Yahoo Finance. If you're unsure how to do this, just download the zip file and import it into eclipse to save any
potential headaches.

This read me will contain a list of things currently that need to fixed or added.

At this moment, some tasks that are required:
  1) Code cleanup (should be done either at end of implementation or during editing)
  2) Log In (requires a log-in that reads from a user database file to determine correct log in credentials. Also requires an
     option to create a new user
  3) Log Out (likely will be initiated by clicking a log out button on the main gui in which case the user is brought back to the
     log in page
  4) Title page?? (everyone should vote on this)
  5) Buy/Sell signals on crossing of moving average and stock prices
  6) CSS Styling of GUI to make it look pretty :)
  
These are some task currently requiring working. This list may be lengthened or shortened as need be.

I (Stephen) will be working on the project this weekend and I will be working on:
  Getting the graph to auto scale to the values of the stock prices
  Event handling for the radio buttons and check boxes on the right side
  
If anyone has any comments, modifications, additions or whatever then feel free to add it here so everyone can see and offer 
their opinions.

A screenshot of the current state (23 March 2017) of the program will be provided for reference in the repo.

Happy Coding!
